# xboxlinkcollection
a csv file full of links to xbox stuff (primarily xvc files)

for simplicity sake, links are either from assets1.xboxlive.com or dlassets.xboxlive.com

this is because assets1 and dlassets are cooler than assets2 and dlassets2. also it makes removing duplicates easier.

## Note
Though there is a lot here, there is also quite a lot NOT here. If you have any links/XVC files for older updates (mostly anything pre 2020-2021) that aren't here, please tell me!! Also let me know if you have links for older Series S/X builds (XVCs unfortunately aren't much help when it comes to those. **Evil** Microsoft. :[ )

If you have any of these, please let me know:
* Fortnite (coincides with another thing of mine, TAke a look, ny'all: https://github.com/Xader726/FortniteXboxBuilds)
* Rock Band 4 (also includes songs if you got them)
